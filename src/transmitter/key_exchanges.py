    Send the Tor Onion Service's private key and list of Onion Service
    public keys of contacts to Relay Program on Networked Computer.

    This private key is not intended to be used by the Transmitter
    Program. Because the Networked Computer we are exporting it to
    might not store data, we use the trusted Source Computer to generate
    the private key and store it safely. The private key is needed by
    Tor on Networked Computer to start the Onion Service.

    Exporting this private key does not endanger message confidentiality
    because TFC uses a separate key exchange with separate private key
    to create the symmetric keys that protect the messages. That private
    key is never exported to the Networked Computer.

    Access to this key does not give to any user any information other
    than the v3 Onion Address. However, if they have compromised Relay
    Program to gain access to the key, they can see its public part
    anyway.

    This key is used by Tor to sign Diffie-Hellman public keys used when
    clients of contacts establish a secure connection to the Onion
    Service. This key can't be used to decrypt traffic retrospectively.

    The worst possible case in the situation of key compromise is, the
    key allows the attacker to start their own copy of the user's Onion
    Service.

    This does not allow impersonating as the user however, because the
    attacker is not in possession of keys that allow them to create
    valid ciphertexts. Even if they inject TFC public keys to conduct a
    MITM attack, that attack will be detected during fingerprint
    comparison.

    In addition to the private key, the Onion Service data packet also
    transmits the list of Onion Service public keys of existing and
    pending contacts to the Relay Program, as well as the setting that
    determines whether contact requests are allowed. Bundling all this
    data in a single packet is great in the sense a single confirmation
    code can be used to ensure that Relay Program has all the
    information necessary to perform its duties.

    the contact's public key reaches the user's Relay Program, the user
    will manually type the key into their Transmitter Program.

    The X448 shared secret is used to create unidirectional message and
    header keys, that will be used in forward secret communication. This
    is followed by the fingerprint verification where the user manually
    authenticates the public key.

    Once the fingerprint has been accepted, this function will add the
    contact/key data to contact/key databases, and export that data to
    the Receiver Program on Destination Computer. The transmission is
    encrypted with the local key.

    ---

    TFC provides proactive security by making fingerprint verification
    part of the key exchange. This prevents the situation where the
    users don't know about the feature, and thus helps minimize the risk
    of MITM attack.

    The fingerprints can be skipped by pressing Ctrl+C. This feature is
    not advertised however, because verifying fingerprints the only
    strong way to be sure TFC is not under MITM attack. When
    verification is skipped, TFC marks the contact's X448 keys as
    "Unverified". The fingerprints can later be verified with the
    `/verify` command: answering `yes` to the question on whether the
    fingerprints match, marks the X448 keys as "Verified".

    MITM or man-in-the-middle attack is an attack against an inherent

    Cryptography is math, nothing more. During key exchange public keys
    are just very large numbers. There is no way to tell by looking if a
    number (received from an untrusted network / Networked Computer) is
    the same number the contact generated.

    Public key fingerprints are values designed to be compared by humans
    either visually or audibly (or sometimes by using semi-automatic
    means such as QR-codes). By comparing the fingerprint over an
    authenticated channel it's possible to verify that the correct key
