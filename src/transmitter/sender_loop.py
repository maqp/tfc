    The traffic masking loop loads assembly packets from a set of queues.
    As Python's multiprocessing lacks priority queues, several queues are
    prioritized based on their status.

    Files are only transmitted when messages are not being output: This
    is because file transmission is usually very slow and the user might
    need to send messages in the meantime. Command datagrams are output
    from Source Computer between each message datagram. The frequency in
    output allows commands to take effect as soon as possible but this
    unfortunately slows down message/file delivery by half. Each contact
    in the window is cycled in order.

    When this loop is active, making changes to the recipient list is
    prevented to protect the user from accidentally revealing the use of
    TFC.

    The traffic is masked the following way: If both m_queue and f_queue
    are empty, a noise assembly packet is loaded from np_queue. If no
    command packet is available in c_queue, a noise command packet is
    loaded from nc_queue. Both noise queues are filled by independent
    processes that ensure both noise queues always have packets to
    output.

    TFC does its best to hide the assembly packet loading times and
    encryption duration by using constant time context manager with
    CSPRNG spawned jitter, constant time queue status lookup and constant
    time XChaCha20 cipher. However, since TFC is written in a high-level
    language, it is impossible to guarantee Source Computer never
    reveals to Networked Computer when the user operates the Source
    Computer.

    The standard sender loop loads assembly packets from a set of queues.
    As Python's multiprocessing lacks priority queues, several queues are
    prioritized based on their status:

    KEY_MANAGEMENT_QUEUE has the highest priority. This is to ensure the
    no queued message/command is encrypted with expired keyset.

    COMMAND_PACKET_QUEUE has the second highest priority, to ensure
    commands are issued swiftly to Receiver program. Some commands like
    screen clearing might need to be issued quickly.

    RELAY_PACKET_QUEUE has third highest priority. These are still
    commands but since Relay Program does not handle sensitive data,
    issuing commands to that devices does not take priority.

    Buffered messages have fourth highest priority. This ensures that if
    for whatever reason the keyset is removed, buffered messages do not
    get lost. Packets are loaded from the buffer in FIFO basis ensuring
    packets arrive to the recipient in order.

    MESSAGE_PACKET_QUEUE has fifth highest priority. Any buffered
    messages need to arrive earlier, thus new messages must be
    prioritized after the buffered ones.

    SENDER_MODE_QUEUE has sixth highest priority. This prevents outgoing
    packets from being left in the queues used by this loop. This queue
    returns up-to-date settings object for `sender_loop` parent loop,
    that in turn uses it to start `traffic_masking_loop`.

    Along with settings, this function returns the m_buffer status so that
    assembly packets that could not have been sent due to missing key
    can be output later, if the user resumes to standard_sender_loop and
    adds new keys for the contact.
