    BLAKE2 is the successor of SHA3-finalist BLAKE*, designed by
    Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn and
    Christian Winnerlein. The hash function is based on the ChaCha20
    stream cipher, designed by djb.

    The reasons for using BLAKE2b in TFC include

        o BLAKE received* more in-depth cryptanalysis than Keccak (SHA3):

          "Keccak received a significant amount of cryptanalysis,
           although not quite the depth of analysis applied to BLAKE,
           Grøstl, or Skein."
           (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf  # p. 13)

          * https://blake2.net/#cr

        o BLAKE shares design elements with SHA-2 that has 16 years of
          cryptanalysis behind it.
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Cryptanalysis_and_validation)

        o 128-bit collision/preimage/second-preimage resistance against
          Grover's algorithm running on a quantum Turing machine.

        o The algorithm is bundled in Python3.6's hashlib.

        o Compared to SHA3-256, the algorithm runs faster on CPUs which
          means better hash ratchet performance.

        o Compared to SHA3-256, the algorithm runs slower on ASICs which
          means attacks by high-budget adversaries are slower.

    Note that while the default length of BLAKE2b (the implementation
    optimized for AMD64 systems) digest is 512 bits, the digest size is
    truncated to 256 bits for the use in TFC.

    The correctness of the BLAKE2b implementation* is tested by TFC unit
    tests. The testing is done in limited scope by using an official KAT.

    Argon2 is a key derivation function (KDF) designed by Alex Biryukov,
    Daniel Dinu, and Dmitry Khovratovich from the University of
    Luxembourg. The algorithm is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing
    Competition (PHC).

    For more details, see
        https://password-hashing.net/
        https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/argon2-specs.pdf
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2

    The purpose of the KDF is to stretch a password into a 256-bit key.
    Argon2 features a slow, memory-hard hash function that consumes
    computational resources of an attacker that attempts a dictionary
    or a brute force attack. The accompanied 256-bit salt prevents
    rainbow-table attacks, forcing each attack to take place against an
    individual (physically compromised) TFC-endpoint, or PSK
    transmission media.

    The used Argon2 version is Argon2d that uses data-dependent memory
    access, which maximizes security against time-memory trade-off
    (TMTO) attacks at the risk of side-channel attacks. The IETF
    recommends using Argon2id (that is side-channel resistant and almost
    as secure as Argon2d against TMTO attacks) **except** when there is
    a reason to prefer Argon2d (or Argon2i). The reason TFC uses Argon2d
    is key derivation only takes place on Source and Destination
    Computer. As these computers are connected to the Networked Computer
    only via a data diode, they do not leak any information via
    side-channels to the adversary. The expected attacks are against
    physically compromised data storage devices where the encrypted data
    is at rest. In such situation, Argon2d is the most secure option.

    The correctness of the Argon2d implementation* is tested by TFC unit
    tests. The testing is done in limited scope by using an official KAT.

    ChaCha20 is a stream cipher published by Daniel J. Bernstein (djb)
    in 2008. The algorithm is an improved version of Salsa20 -- another
    stream cipher by djb -- selected by ECRYPT into the eSTREAM
    portfolio in 2008. The improvement in question is, ChaCha20
    increases the per-round diffusion compared to Salsa20 while
    maintaining or increasing speed.

    of the ChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF (RFC 7539**). Quoting libsodium, the
    XChaCha20 (=eXtended-nonce ChaCha20) variant allows encryption of
    ~2^64 bytes per message, encryption of up to 2^64 messages per key,
    and safe use of random nonces due to the 192-bit nonce space***.

    """Generate a cryptographically secure random key.

    The default key length is 256 bits.

    The key is generated by the Linux kernel's cryptographically secure
    pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).

    Since Python 3.6.0, `os.urandom` is a wrapper for best available
    CSPRNG. The 3.17 and earlier versions of Linux kernel do not support
    the GETRANDOM call, and Python 3.6's `os.urandom` will in those
    cases fall back to non-blocking `/dev/urandom` that is not secure on
    live distros as they have low entropy at the start of the session.

    TFC uses `os.getrandom(n, flags=0)` explicitly. This forces use of
    recent enough Python interpreter (3.6.0 or later) and limits Linux
    kernel version to 3.17 or later.* The flag 0 will block urandom if
    the internal state of the CSPRNG has less than 128 bits of entropy.
    See PEP 524 for more details:
        https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0524/

    * The `/dev/urandom` was redesigned around ChaCha20 in the version
      4.8 of Linux kernel (https://lwn.net/Articles/686033/), so as a
      good practice TFC runs the `check_kernel_version` to ensure only
      the new design of the CSPRNG is used.

    Quoting PEP 524:
        "The os.getrandom() is a thin wrapper on the getrandom()
         syscall/C function and so inherit of its behaviour. For
         example, on Linux, it can return less bytes than
         requested if the syscall is interrupted by a signal."

    However, quoting (https://lwn.net/Articles/606141/) on GETRANDOM:
        "--reads of 256 bytes or less from /dev/urandom are guaranteed to
         return the full request once that device has been initialized."

    Since the largest key generated in TFC is the 56-byte X448 private
    key, GETRANDOM is guaranteed to always work. As a good practice
    however, TFC checks that the length of the obtained entropy is
    correct.

    The output of GETRANDOM is further compressed with BLAKE2b. The
    preimage resistance of the hash function protects the internal
    state of the entropy pool just in case some user decides to modify
    the source to accept pre-4.8 Linux Kernel that has no backtracking
    protection. Another reason for the hashing is its recommended by djb:
        https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7210-pqchacks#video&t=1116

    Since BLAKE2b only produces 1..64 byte digests, its use limits the
    size of the key to 64 bytes. This is not a problem for TFC because
    again, the largest key it generates is the 56-byte X448 private key.
