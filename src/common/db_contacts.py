class Contact(object):
    """\
    Contact object contains contact data not related to key management
    and hash ratchet state:

      onion_pub_key: The public key of the contact's v3 Tor Onion
                     Service. The Relay Program on user's Networked
                     Computer uses this public key to anonymously
                     discover the Onion Service and to authenticate the
                     end-to-end encryption used between Relay Computers.
                     Since Relay Program might run on an amnesic distro
                     like Tails, the Transmitter and Receiver Programs
                     handle long-term storage of the contact's Onion
                     Service public key. All `onion_pub_key` variables
                     across the codebase refer to the public key of a
                     contact (never that of the user).

               nick: As per Zooko's triangle and Stiegler's Petname
                     Systems, .onion names (i.e., TFC accounts) cannot
                     be global, secure and memorable at the same time*.
                     To deal with hard to remember accounts, in TFC
                     contacts (and groups) are managed mostly with
                     nicknames assigned by the user. The nickname must
                     be unique among both contacts and groups so that
                     single command `/msg <selection>` can select a
                     specific contact or group. Some nicknames are
                     reserved so that messages from contacts cannot be
                     confused with system messages of Receiver Program.
                     Nicknames also have a length limit of 254 chars.

    * https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HiddenServiceNames#Whyare.onionnamescreatedthatway

    TFC stores the 32-byte public key fingerprints of the ECDHE key
    exchange into the contact database. These values allow the user to
    verify at any time no MITM attack took place during the key
    exchange. When PSKs are used, a null-byte string is used as a
    placeholder value.

     tx_fingerprint: The user's fingerprint. This fingerprint is derived
                     from the user's public key which means it's
                     automatically authentic. During verification over
                     an authenticated channel, the user reads this value
                     to the contact out loud.

     rx_fingerprint: The purported fingerprint for the contact. This
                     fingerprint depends on the public key received from
                     the insecure network and therefore, it shouldn't be
                     trusted implicitly. During verification over an
                     authenticated channel, the contact reads their
                     `tx_fingerprint` to the user out loud, and the user
                     then compares it to this purported value.

         kex_status: This byte remembers the key exchange status of the
                     contact.

    TFC stores the contact-specific settings to the contact database:

       log_messages: This setting defines whether the Receiver Program
                     on Destination Computer writes the assembly packets
                     of a successfully received message into a log file.
                     When logging is enabled, Transmitter Program will
                     also log assembly packets of sent messages to its
                     log file.

     file_reception: This setting defines whether the Receiver Program
                     accepts files sent by the contact. The setting has
                     no effect on user's Transmitter Program.

      notifications: This setting defines whether, in situations where
                     some other window is active, the Receiver Program
                     displays a notification about the contact sending
                     a new message to their window. The setting has no
                     effect on user's Transmitter Program.

    tfc_private_key: This value is an ephemerally stored private key
                     for situations where the user interrupts the key
                     exchange. The purpose of the value is to prevent
                     the user from generating different ECDHE values
                     when re-selecting the contact to continue the key
                     exchange. Note that once a shared key is derived
                     from this private key (and contact's public key),
                     it is discarded. New private key will thus be
                     generated if the users decide to exchange new keys
                     with each other.
