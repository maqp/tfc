        The generated master key depends on a 256-bit salt and the
        password entered by the user. Additional computational strength
        is added by the slow hash function (Argon2id). The more cores
        and the faster each core is, and the more memory the system has,
        the more secure TFC data is under the same password.

        This method automatically tweaks the Argon2 time and memory cost
        parameters according to best practices as determined in

            https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-09#section-4

        1) For Argon2 type (y), Argon2id was selected because the
           adversary might be able to run arbitrary code on Destination
           Computer and thus perform a side-channel attack against the
           function.

        2) The maximum number of threads (h) is determined by the number
           available in the system. However, during local testing this
           number is reduced to half to allow simultaneous login to
           Transmitter and Receiver Program.

        3) The maximum amount of memory (m) is what the system has to
           offer. For hard-drive encryption purposes, the recommendation
           is 6GiB. TFC will use that amount (or even more) if available.
           However, on less powerful systems, it will settle for less.

        4) For key derivation time (x), the value is set to at least 3
           seconds, with the maximum being 4 seconds. The minimum value
           is the same as the recommendation for hard-drive encryption.

        5) The salt length is set to 256-bits which is double the
           recommended length. The salt size ensures that even in a
           group of 4.8*10^29 users, the probability that two users
           share the same salt is just 10^(-18).*
            * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack

           The salt does not need additional protection as the security
           it provides depends on the salt space in relation to the
           number of attacked targets (i.e. if two or more physically
           compromised systems happen to share the same salt, the
           attacker can speed up the attack against those systems with
           time-memory-trade-off attack).

        6) The tag length isn't utilized. The result of the key
           derivation is the master encryption key itself, which is set
           to 32 bytes for use in XChaCha20-Poly1305.

        7) Memory wiping feature is not provided.

        To recognize the password is correct, the BLAKE2b hash of the
        master key is stored together with key derivation parameters
        into the login database.
            The preimage resistance of BLAKE2b prevents derivation of
        master key from the stored hash, and Argon2id ensures brute
        force and dictionary attacks against the master password are
        painfully slow even with GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs, as long as the
        password is sufficiently strong.

        There are two acceptable time_cost values.

        1. A time_cost value that together with all available memory
           sets the key derivation time between MIN_KEY_DERIVATION_TIME
           and MAX_KEY_DERIVATION_TIME. If during the search we find
           such suitable time_cost value, we accept it as such.

        2. In a situation where no time_cost value is suitable alone,
           there will exist some time_cost value `t` that makes key
           derivation too fast, and another time_cost value `t+1` that
           makes key derivation too slow. In this case we are interested
           in the latter value, as unlike `t`, the value `t+1` can be
           fine-tuned to suitable key derivation time range by adjusting
           the memory_cost parameter.

        As time_cost has no upper limit, and as the amount of available
        memory has tremendous effect on how long one round takes, it's
        difficult to determine the upper bound for a time_cost binary
        search. We therefore start with a single round, and by
        benchmarking it, estimate how many rounds are needed to reach
        the target zone. After every try, we update our time_cost
        candidate based on new average time per round estimate, a value
        that gets more accurate as the search progresses. If this
        method isn't able to suggest a value larger than 1, we increase
        time_cost by 1 anyway to prevent an Alderson loop.

        Every time the time_cost value is increased, we update the lower
        bound to narrow the search space of the binary search we can
        switch to immediately, once the MAX_KEY_DERIVATION_TIME is
        exceeded (i.e. once an upper bound is found). At that point, the
