Reed Solomon
============

A pure-python universal errors-and-erasures Reed-Solomon Codec
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction

based on the wonderful tutorial at
    https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_codes_for_coders
    written by "Bobmath" and "LRQ3000".

The code of wikiversity is here consolidated into a nice API with
exceptions handling. The algorithm can correct up to 2*e+v <= nsym,
where e is the number of errors, v the number of erasures and
nsym = n-k = the number of ECC (error correction code) symbols. This
means that you can either correct exactly floor(nsym/2) errors, or nsym
erasures (errors where you know the position), and a combination of
both errors and erasures. The code should work on pretty much any
reasonable version of python (2.4-3.5), but I'm only testing on 2.7-3.4.

.. note::
   The codec is universal, meaning that it can decode any message
   encoded by another RS encoder as long as you provide the correct
   parameters. Note however that if you use higher fields
   (i.e., bigger c_exp), the algorithms will be slower, first because
   we cannot then use the optimized bytearray() structure but only
   array.array('i', ...), and also because Reed-Solomon's complexity is
   quadratic (both in encoding and decoding), so this means that the
   longer your messages, the longer it will take to encode/decode
   (quadratically!).

   The algorithm itself can handle messages up to (2^c_exp)-1 symbols,
   including the ECC symbols, and each symbol can have a value of up to
   (2^c_exp)-1 (indeed, both the message length and the maximum value
   for one character is constrained by the same mathematical reason).
   By default, we use the field GF(2^8), which means that you are
   limited to values between 0 and 255 (perfect to represent a single
   hexadecimal symbol on computers, so you can encode any binary
   stream) and limited to messages+ecc of maximum length 255. However,
   you can "chunk" longer messages to fit them into the message length
   limit. The ``RSCodec`` class will automatically apply chunking, by
   splitting longer messages into chunks and encode/decode them
   separately; it shouldn't make a difference from an API perspective
   (i.e., from your POV).

    # Initialization
    # >>> from reedsolo import RSCodec
    # >>> rsc = RSCodec(10)  # 10 ecc symbols

    # # Encoding
    # >>> rsc.encode([1,2,3,4])
    # b'\x01\x02\x03\x04,\x9d\x1c+=\xf8h\xfa\x98M'

    # # Note that chunking is supported transparently to encode any string length.

    # >>> rsc = RSCodec(12)  # using 2 more ecc symbols (to correct max 6 errors or 12 erasures)
    # >>> rsc.encode(b'hello world')
    # b'hello world?Ay\xb2\xbc\xdc\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2='
    # >>> rsc.decode(b'hello worXXXXy\xb2XX\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2=')[0]         # 6 errors - ok
    # b'hello world'
    # >>> rsc.decode(b'helXXXXXXXXXXy\xb2XX\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2=', erase_pos=[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16])[0]
    # b'hello world'

    # Checking
    >> rsc.check(b'hello worXXXXy\xb2XX\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2=')
    [False]
    >> rmes, rmesecc = rsc.decode(b'hello worXXXXy\xb2XX\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2=')
    >> rsc.check(rmesecc)
    [True]

    # To use longer chunks or bigger values than 255 (may be very slow)
    >> rsc = RSCodec(12, nsize=4095)  # always use a power of 2 minus 1
    >> rsc = RSCodec(12, c_exp=12)  # alternative way to set nsize=4095
    >> mes = 'a' * (4095-12)
    >> mesecc = rsc.encode(mes)
    >> mesecc[2] = 1
    >> mesecc[-1] = 1
    >> rmes, rmesecc = rsc.decode(mesecc)
    >> rsc.check(mesecc)
    [False]
    >> rsc.check(rmesecc)
    [True]

    If you want full control, you can skip the API and directly use the
    library as-is. Here's how:

    First you need to init the precomputed tables:
    >> import reedsolo as rs
    >> rs.init_tables(0x11d)

    Pro tip: if you get the error: ValueError: byte must be in
    range(0, 256), please check that your prime polynomial is correct
    for your field.

    Pro tip2: by default, you can only encode messages of max length
    and max symbol value = 256. If you want to encode bigger messages,
    please use the following (where c_exp is the exponent of your
    Galois Field, e.g., 12 = max length 2^12 = 4096):
    >> prim = rs.find_prime_polys(c_exp=12, fast_primes=True, single=True)
    >> rs.init_tables(c_exp=12, prim=prim)

    Let's define our RS message and ecc size:
    >> n = 255               # length of total message+ecc
    >> nsym = 12             # length of ecc
    >> mes = "a" * (n-nsym)  # generate a sample message

    To optimize, you can precompute the generator polynomial:
    >> gen = rs.rs_generator_poly_all(n)

    Then to encode:
    >> mesecc = rs.rs_encode_msg(mes, nsym, gen=gen[nsym])

    Let's tamper our message:
    >> mesecc[1] = 0

    To decode:
    >> rmes, recc = rs.rs_correct_msg(mesecc, nsym, erase_pos=erase_pos)

    Note that both the message and the ecc are corrected (if possible
    of course).

    Pro tip: if you know a few erasures positions, you can specify them
    in a list `erase_pos` to double the repair power. But you can also
    just specify an empty list.

    If the decoding fails, it will normally automatically check and
    raise a ReedSolomonError exception that you can handle. However
    if you want to manually check if the repaired message is correct,
    you can do so:
    >> rs.rs_check(rmes + recc, nsym)

    Note: if you want to use multiple Reed-Solomon with different
    parameters, you need to backup the globals and restore them before
    calling reedsolo functions:

    >> rs.init_tables()
    >> global gf_log, gf_exp, field_charac
    >> bak_gf_log, bak_gf_exp, bak_field_charac = gf_log, gf_exp, field_charac

    Then at anytime, you can do:
    >> global gf_log, gf_exp, field_charac
    >> gf_log, gf_exp, field_charac = bak_gf_log, bak_gf_exp, bak_field_charac
    >> mesecc = rs.rs_encode_msg(mes, nsym)
    >> rmes, recc = rs.rs_correct_msg(mesecc, nsym)

    The globals backup is not necessary if you use RSCodec, it will be
    automatically managed. Read the source code's comments for more info
    about how it works, and for the various parameters you can setup if
    you need to interface with other RS codecs.

TO DO IMPORTANT: try to keep the same convention for the ordering of
polynomials inside lists throughout the code and functions (because
for now, there are a lot of list reversing in order to make it work,
you never know the order of a polynomial, i.e., if the first coefficient
is the major degree or the constant term...).

    Compute the list of prime polynomials for the given generator and
    Galois Field characteristic exponent.

    fast_primes will output less results but will be significantly faster.
    Single will output the first prime polynomial found, so if all you
    want is to just find one prime polynomial to generate the LUT for
    Reed-Solomon to work, then just use that.

    A prime polynomial (necessarily irreducible) is necessary to reduce
    the multiplications in the Galois Field, so as to avoid overflows.

    Why do we need a "prime polynomial"? Can't we just reduce modulo 255
    (for GF(2^8) for example)? Because we need the values to be unique.

    For example: if the generator (alpha) = 2 and c_exp = 8 (GF(2^8) == GF(256)),
    then the generated Galois Field (0, 1, α, α^1, α^2, ..., α^(p-1))
    will be Galois Field it becomes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. However,
    upon reaching 128, the next value will be doubled (i.e., next power of
    2), which will give 256. Then we must reduce, because we have
    overflowed above the maximum value of 255. But, if we modulo 255,
    this will generate 256 == 1. Then 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. giving us a
    repeating pattern of numbers. This is very bad, as it's then not
    anymore a bijection (i.e., a non-zero value doesn't have a unique
    index). That's why we can't just modulo 255, but we need another
    number above 255, which is called the prime polynomial.
    # Why so much hassle? Because we are using precomputed look-up
    tables for multiplication: instead of multiplying a*b, we precompute
    alpha^a, alpha^b and alpha^(a+b), so that we can just use our lookup
    table at alpha^(a+b) and get our result. But just like in our
    original field we had 0,1,2,...,p-1 distinct unique values, in our
    "LUT" field using alpha we must have unique distinct values (we
    don't care that they are different from the original field as long
    as they are unique and distinct). That's why we need to avoid
    duplicated values, and to avoid duplicated values we need to use a
    prime irreducible polynomial.

    # Here is implemented a brute-force approach to find all these prime
    polynomials, by generating every possible prime polynomials (i.e.,
    every integers between field_charac+1 and field_charac*2), and then
    we build the whole Galois Field, and we reject the candidate prime
    polynomial if it duplicates even one value or if it generates a
    value above field_charac (i.e., cause an overflow).

    Note that this algorithm is slow if the field is too big (above 12),
    because it's an exhaustive search algorithm. There are probabilistic
    approaches, and almost surely prime approaches, but there is no
    deterministic polynomial time algorithm to find irreducible monic
    polynomials. More info can be found at:
        https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~csaha/lectures/lec9.pdf

    Precompute the logarithm and anti-log tables for faster computation
    later, using the provided primitive polynomial. These tables are
    used for multiplication/division since addition/substraction are
    simple XOR operations inside GF of characteristic 2.

    The basic idea is quite simple: since b**(log_b(x), log_b(y)) == x * y
    given any number b (the base or generator of the logarithm), then we
    can use any number b to precompute logarithm and anti-log
    (exponentiation) tables to use for multiplying two numbers x and y.
    That's why when we use a different base/generator number, the log
    and anti-log tables are drastically different, but the resulting
    computations are the same given any such tables.
    For more info, see
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic#Implementation_tricks

    Generator is the generator number (the "increment" that will be used
    to walk through the field by multiplication, this must be a prime
    number). This is basically the base of the logarithm/anti-log tables.
    Also often noted "alpha" in academic books.

    Prim is the primitive/prime (binary) polynomial and must be
    irreducible (i.e., it can't represented as the product of two smaller
    polynomials). It's a polynomial in the binary sense: each bit is a
    coefficient, but in fact it's an integer between field_charac+1 and
    field_charac*2, and not a list of gf values. The prime polynomial
    will be used to reduce the overflows back into the range of the
    Galois Field without duplicating values (all values should be
    unique). See the function find_prime_polys() and:
        https://research.swtch.com/field and https://www.pclviewer.com/rs2/galois.html

    Note that the choice of generator or prime polynomial doesn't matter
    very much: any two finite fields of size p^n have identical
    structure, even if they give the individual elements different names
    (i.e., the coefficients of the codeword will be different, but the
    final result will be the same: you can always correct as many
    errors/erasures with any choice for those parameters). That's why it
    makes sense to refer to all the finite fields, and all decoders
    based on Reed-Solomon, of size p^n as one concept: GF(p^n). It can
    however impact sensibly the speed (because some parameters will
    generate sparser tables).
