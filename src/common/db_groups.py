    """\
    Group object contains a list of Contact objects (group members) and
    settings related to the group:

    name:          In TFC, groups are identified by random group IDs
                   that are hard to remember. Groups are therefore
                   managed mostly with names assigned by the user. The
                   name of the group must be unique among group names
                   and nicknames of contacts. This way a single command
                   `/msg <selection>` can select the specified contact
                   or group. Some group names are reserved, e.g., for
                   database padding. Group names also have a length
                   limit of 254 chars.

    group_id:      Group ID is a random 4-byte value used to identify a
                   group among user's peers. To prevent data leakage
                   from Destination Computer via group IDs, the
                   received group management messages are displayed by
                   the Relay Program on Networked Computer. Since group
                   ID must be considered public information, they are
                   random. For more details on Destination Computer
                   exfiltration attacks, refer to TFC's documentation
                   on Security Design. Identification of groups via a
                   separate group ID allows the user to choose the name
                   for the group which is useful because users do not
                   need to take into account what names their contacts
                   have chosen for their groups.

    log_messages:  This setting defines whether the Receiver Program
                   writes the assembly packets of a successfully
                   received group message into a log file. When logging
                   is enabled, Transmitter Program will also log
                   assembly packets of sent group messages to its log
                   file.

    notifications: This setting defines whether in situations where some
                   other window is active the Receiver Program displays
                   a notification about a group member sending a new
                   message to the group's window. The setting has no
                   effect on user's Transmitter Program.

    members:       Manually managed list of Contact objects that the
                   user accepts as members of their side of the group.
                   The Transmitter Program of user multicasts messages
                   to these contacts when the group is active. The
                   Receiver Program of user accepts messages from these
                   contacts to Group's window when the contact sends the
                   user a message, that contains the group ID in its
                   header.

    GroupList object manages TFC's Group objects and the storage of the

    The main purpose of this object is to manage the `self.groups`-list
    that contains TFC's groups. The database is stored on disk in
    encrypted form. Prior to encryption, the database is padded with
    dummy groups. Because each group might have a different number of
    members, each group is also padded with dummy members. The dummy
    groups and members hide the actual number of groups and members that
    could otherwise be revealed by the size of the encrypted database.

    As long as the user sticks to default settings that limits TFC's
    group database to 50 groups and 50 members per group, the database
    will effectively hide the actual number of groups and number of
    members in them. The maximum number of groups and number of members
    per group can be changed by editing the `max_number_of_groups` and
    `max_number_of_group_members` settings respectively. Deviating from
    the default settings can, however, in theory, reveal to a physical
    attacker the user has more than 50 groups or more than 50 members
