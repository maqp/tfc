"""Datagram headers

These headers are prepended to datagrams that are transmitted over
serial or over the network. They tell the receiving device what type of
datagram is in question.

Datagrams with local key header contain the encrypted local key, used to
encrypt commands and data transferred between local Source and 
Destination computers. Packets with the header are only accepted by the 
Relay Program when they originate from the user's Source Computer. Even 
if the Networked Computer is compromised and the local key datagram is 
injected to the Destination Computer, the injected key could not be 
accepted by the user as they don't know the decryption key for it. The
worst case scenario is a DoS attack where the Receiver Program receives 
new local keys continuously. Such an attack would, however, reveal the 
user they are under a sophisticated attack, and that their Networked 
Computer has been compromised.

Datagrams with Public key header contain TCB-level public keys that 
originate from the sender's Source Computer, and are displayed by the
recipient's Networked Computer, from where they are manually typed to
recipient's Destination Computer.

Message and command type datagrams tell the Receiver Program whether to 
parse the trailing fields that determine which XChaCha20-Poly1305 
decryption keys it should load. Contacts can of course try to alter 
their datagrams to contain a COMMAND_DATAGRAM_HEADER header, but Relay 
Program will by design drop them. Even if a compromised Networked 
Computer injects such a datagram to Destination Computer, the Receiver 
Program will drop the datagram when the MAC verification of the 
encrypted hash ratchet counter value fails.

File type datagram contains an encrypted file that the Receiver Program 
caches until its decryption key arrives from the sender inside a 
special, automated key delivery message.

Unencrypted type datagrams contain commands intended for the Relay 
Program. These commands are in some cases preceded by an encrypted 
version of the command, that the Relay Program forwards to Receiver 
Program on Destination Computer. The unencrypted Relay commands are 
disabled during traffic masking to hide the quantity and schedule of 
communication even from the Networked Computer (in case it's compromised 
and monitoring the user). The fact these commands are unencrypted, do 
not cause security issues because if an adversary can compromise the 
Networked Computer to the point it can issue commands to the Relay 
Program, they could DoS the Relay Program, and thus TFC, anyway.

unauthorized group windows, because TFC's manually managed group

display messages under the group's window.

whispered messages are not logged regardless of in-program controlled
settings.
