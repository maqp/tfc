    """Load persistent data and launch the Transmitter/Receiver Program.

    This function decrypts user data from databases and launches
    processes for Transmitter or Receiver Program. It then monitors the
    EXIT_QUEUE for EXIT/WIPE signals and each process in case one of
    them dies.

    If you're reading this code to get the big picture on how TFC works,
    start by looking at the loop functions below, defined as the target
    for each process, from top to bottom:
        From `input_loop` process, you can see how the Transmitter
    Program processes a message or command from the user, creates
    assembly packets for a message/file/command, and how those are
    eventually pushed into a multiprocessing queue, from where they are
    loaded by the `sender_loop`.
        The `sender_loop` process encrypts outgoing assembly packets,
    and outputs the encrypted datagrams to the Networked Computer. The
    process also sends assembly packets to the `log_writer_loop`.
        The `log_writer_loop` process filters out non-message assembly
    packets and if logging for contact is enabled, stores the message
    assembly packet into an encrypted log database.
        The `noise_loop` processes are used to provide the `sender_loop`
    an interface identical to that of the `input_loop`. The
    `sender_loop` uses the interface to load noise packets/commands when
    traffic masking is enabled.

    Refer to the file `relay.py` to see how the Relay Program on
    Networked Computer manages datagrams between the network and
    Source/Destination Computer.

    In Receiver Program (also launched by this file), the `gateway_loop`
    process acts as a buffer for incoming datagrams. This buffer is
    consumed by the `receiver_loop` process that organizes datagrams
    loaded from the buffer into a set of queues depending on datagram
    type. Finally, the `output_loop` process loads and processes
    datagrams from the queues in the order of priority.
